## Seed code - Boilerplate for RDBMS - Assignment

### Assignment Step Description

Read the given set of questions and solve them by writing queries using MySQL

### Problem Statement

Note management app (similar to Google Keep) is used to take notes, add notes into categories and set reminders for a note. Create the necessary DB schema (MySQL) including
tables, relationships, triggers and add sample data into each table.

### Expected Solution

Create the tables for Note, Category, Reminder, User, UserNote, NoteReminder and NoteCategory.

User table fields: user_id, user_name, user_added_date, user_password, user_mobile

Note table fields: note_id, note_title, note_content, note_status, note_creation_date

Category table fields : category_id, category_name, category_descr, category_creation_date, category_creator

Reminder table fields : reminder_id, reminder_name, reminder_descr, reminder_type, reminder_creation_date, reminder_creator

NoteCategory table fields : notecategory_id, note_id, category_id

Notereminder table fields : notereminder_id, note_id, reminder_id

usernote table fields : usernote_id, user_id, note_id


Insert the rows into the created tables (Note, Category, Reminder, User, UserNote, NoteReminder and NoteCategory).

Fetch the row from User table based on Id and Password.

Fetch all the rows from Note table based on the field note_creation_date.

Fetch all the Categories created after the particular Date.

Fetch all the Note ID from UserNote table for a given User.

Write Update query to modify particular Note for the given note Id.

Fetch all the Notes from the Note table by a particular User.

Fetch all the Notes from the Note table for a particular Category.

Fetch all the reminder details for a given note id.

Fetch the reminder details for a given reminder id.

Write a query to create a new Note from particular User (Use Note and UserNote tables - insert statement).

Write a query to create a new Note from particular User to particular Category(Use Note and NoteCategory tables - insert statement)

Write a query to set a reminder for a particular note (Use Reminder and NoteReminder tables - insert statement)

Write a query to delete particular Note added by a User(Note and UserNote tables - delete statement)

Write a query to delete particular Note from particular Category(Note and NoteCategory tables - delete statement)

Create a trigger to delete all matching records from UserNote, NoteReminder and NoteCategory table when :
	1. A particular note is deleted from Note table (all the matching records from UserNote, NoteReminder and NoteCategory should be removed automatically) 
	2. A particular user is deleted from User table (all the matching notes should be removed automatically)
